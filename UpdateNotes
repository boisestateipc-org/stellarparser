On 11Apr2024 this project became an offical cyberdome project.

11Apr2024 Functionality
    -program involving 4 files.  The program itself, a configuration file, an input file, and an output file
    -currently it works by taking in values from the config file and searching for them and the next token
        in the input file.
        -then it appends those two values to the output file.
        -Run like this .exe infile.txt outfile.txt
        -overwrites and creates a new outfile, even if it has the same name

Where it's going
     -fix some output bugs
     -then create functionality for it to spit out an Atlassian markdown formatted jira ticket.
     -Create functionality to spit for weekly report
     -Create functionality to parse and create a monthly report

11APR2024
    -Working on fixing the description bug. I will probably just magic code this
        -ended up using getline, which I should have started with. May convert all that logic to getline
    -delimiter idea noted in config file for future

12APR2024
    -Initial Push to Github
    -Current  functionality - .exe inputfile output file, spits out desired values into output file.
    -Significantly cleaned up parsing logic using getline().
    -Started on Jira ticke generation

13APR2024
    -Fixed mild bug involving skipping over a token when using the getline
    -Added parsing rule for '[' (bracketed list).
    
15APR2024
    -Added "Brace" functinality.  Any given parameter that "opens" into a structure will grab everything until the end of that structure's level
    -Working on method to seperate alerts that is not field dependant EG (if amsg then new alert).  Surprisingly difficult.
       -Tried this for a hot minute and ended up going back to "amsg" being the end alert flag.  
        -Sometimes there's one alert ofter that, but that's pretty niche.  For now, I'll just assume it always has that flag
        -Largely failed due to disparities between alerts and desired fields causing disparities between the indices
    -Believe amsg will work as a flag between alerts, so I'm going to press forward and remove it from the to do list
    -Started on creating ticketOutfile

16APR2024
    -Created a base format for Jira Out Ticket
      -Added most of the Markdown functinality to it.  
    -Added function to sanitize non printable characters (\n) from the end of strings
    -Added function to add Markdown Bold characters to string
    -Added function to add Markdown Italic characters to string

Next 50 meter target
   -- Need to gather base fields for the alerts
      -toying with string matrix
      -or structure
      -probably a better way, but the best way, is the one that got done

100M Target
   --WHY IS THERE NO LIBRARY TO JUST CONVERT UNIX TIME TO READABLE FORMAT
      -Seriously, why?
      -Why do I have to recreate this, of all things?
      -How many people have already solved and resolved this SINCE 1970!?
   --Do I need to make the output alert table extensible or is that just too many options?

           --Auto connect to VirusTotal API? Could be very ambitious

           --Need to find a way to spit out top level domain query without reduncies
             -Meh, it's not a huge issue at the moment.  M
                ***Can create a boolean found value, but that can get tricky later, keeping track of it is a pain
