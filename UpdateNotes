On 11Apr2024 this project became an offical cyberdome project.

11Apr2024 Functionality
    -program involving 4 files.  The program itself, a configuration file, an input file, and an output file
    -currently it works by taking in values from the config file and searching for them and the next token
        in the input file.
        -then it appends those two values to the output file.
        -Run like this .exe infile.txt outfile.txt
        -overwrites and creates a new outfile, even if it has the same name

Where it's going
     -fix some output bugs
     -then create functionality for it to spit out an Atlassian markdown formatted jira ticket.
     -Create functionality to spit for weekly report
     -Create functionality to parse and create a monthly report

11APR2024
    -Working on fixing the description bug. I will probably just magic code this
        -ended up using getline, which I should have started with. May convert all that logic to getline
    -delimiter idea noted in config file for future

12APR2024
    -Initial Push to Github
    -Current  functionality - .exe inputfile output file, spits out desired values into output file.
    -Significantly cleaned up parsing logic using getline().
    -Started on Jira ticke generation

13APR2024
    -Fixed mild bug involving skipping over a token when using the getline
    -Added parsing rule for '[' (bracketed list).
    
15APR2024
    -Added "Brace" functinality.  Any given parameter that "opens" into a structure will grab everything until the end of that structure's level
    -Working on method to seperate alerts that is not field dependant EG (if amsg then new alert).  Surprisingly difficult.
       -Tried this for a hot minute and ended up going back to "amsg" being the end alert flag.  
        -Sometimes there's one alert ofter that, but that's pretty niche.  For now, I'll just assume it always has that flag
        -Largely failed due to disparities between alerts and desired fields causing disparities between the indices
    -Believe amsg will work as a flag between alerts, so I'm going to press forward and remove it from the to do list
    -Started on creating ticketOutfile

16APR2024
    -Created a base format for Jira Out Ticket
      -Added most of the Markdown functinality to it.  
    -Added function to sanitize non printable characters (\n) from the end of strings
    -Added function to add Markdown Bold characters to string
    -Added function to add Markdown Italic characters to string

17APR2024
    -Chasing a sneaky bug somewhere in the if else if logic for pushing tokens AFTER a match is found.
    -it's pretty tricky, I've run this code hundreds of times and it only shows up now and again, but I can nearly
        completely recreate it
    -worked awhile on my own time because it was ...bugging... me. Found and fixed it.  It had to do with 
      two things, one i was double loading from my infile in certain instances, and two I never stopped the check
      loop if it found what it was looking for, resulting in loading in new tokens in the middle of the check cycle.  
      The new token would get checked against the left over unchecked tokens of the current check cycle.  At the end
      a new token would get cycled in.  This made the bug extremely difficult to catch, becuase it was possible for
      the next new token to be found in the leftover check cycle.

18APR2024
    -In the thick of working on the gathering alert values phase. 
    -Logic is getting more convoluted and it's broken somewhere.
    -Left off near line 153, creating logic to make new vectors of structures for each alert.
    -I don't want to push anything until it works.

19APR2024
    -Progressed quite a bit.  I had a quiet syntax error in how I was pushing a new object onto a vector of structures that contains a vector.
    -Fixed another small bug with keyFields that would have haunted me later
    
23APR2024
    -Added logic at end of program to create alert table and head values from variables parsed from config file

24APR2024
    -I think it's there, except for putting in more error handling and better documentation.
    -Creates 2 output files, the parsed results from the alerts and optionally a markdown Jira Ticket.
    -After much heartache and possibly some vulgarity discovered time.h and ctime.

25APR2024
    -Tuned logic that converts unix time to readable time to apply to any chosen alert field with "time" in it.
    -Found a bug.

29APR2024
    - https://cyberdome.us/cases/case-detail/663012f41c8bb361fd5f101d when tactic was in config it spit it out twice

2MAY2024
    -Updated documentation getting it prepped for the masses

Next 50 meter target
