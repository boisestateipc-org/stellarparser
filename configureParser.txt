   This is your configuration file.
    -Don't change this file's name, it's name is supposed to be "configureParser.txt"
    -Place this file in the same folder as the program 
    -Add "***SILENT***" to stop the Read in messages 
    -Add "***REPORT*** youroutputfile.txt" to generate Jira Ticket format -- CURRENTLY REQUIRED to be present for program to work
        -Everything between "***REPORTSTART***" and "***REPORTEND***" will be present in the report file and the alert parser out file.
          -IMPORTANT the report alert fields ONLY work with values that are sentences or single values. 
          -It will not work with arrays or structures as contained in the JSON file
    -Values BELOW the "***START***" flag are what the parser looks for.  If it finds that value, both that value and the next
        token are appended to the created outfile.
    -The only value you currently can NOT search for effectively is "asmg" and anything below it.
          -As far as I can tell this would be an extremely niche use case, so not worth the extra code
